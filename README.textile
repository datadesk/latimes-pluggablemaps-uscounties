A pluggable "GeoDjango":http://geodjango.org/ app with the boundaries of United States counties. Geography, loosely coupled.

<blink>Beware. This software is in beta testing and hasn't been used much. But don't let that stop you! Please try it and tell me what sucks.</blink>

h2. Features

* A ready-to-serve model with all the counties in the United States
* Geometry fields for three of the most common SRIDs.
* Simplified geometry fields that thin down the data and make it easier to display many polygons on a single map.
* A read-only admin for reviewing the data
* Templates that show how the counties can be displayed with common browser-based mapping libraries.

h2. Requirements

Before you begin, you will need to have a Django project with GeoDjango's 'django.contrib.gis' app installed and configured. The official installation guide is "here":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/. The official tutorial is "here":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/. Both are excellent.

h2. Installation

h3. 01. Install the source code

You can download it from PyPi.
<pre><code>pip install latimes-pluggablemaps-uscounties</code></pre>

Or, pull the trunk from github
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/datadesk/latimes-pluggablemaps-uscounties.git</code></pre>

h3. 02. Install the app in your Django project

In settings.py's INSTALLED_APPS tuple, add the following.
<pre><code>'us_counties',</code></pre>

h3. 03. Create the database tables

From the shell, enter:
<pre><code>python manage.py syncdb</code></pre>

h3. 04. Load the data

From the same shell, enter the following. Then go get a cup of coffee because this takes forever. Sorry about that. Maybe "this Denzel spoof":http://www.hulu.com/watch/193067/saturday-night-live-unstoppable-trailer can make up for it.
<pre><code>python manage.py loaduscounties</code></pre>

h3. 05. Check out the demostration maps

In in your urls.py file's urlpatterns tuple, add the following.
<pre><code>(r'^us-counties/', include('us_counties.urls')),</code></pre>

Check out the OpenLayers demo by visiting:
<pre><code>http://localhost:8000/us-counties/openlayers/</code></pre>

h2. Version 1 Roadmap

# A speedier loader that doesn't require a huge file download
# Class-based generic views
# A polymaps example
# A raphael example
# Unit tests
# help_text entries for the fields that define the different codes
# Figure out display names for functional status codes. Anyone know them?
# Managers that limit the counties to the lower 48 or the 50 states
# Examples that show how you could "loosely couple" one or more data-based apps and models.
